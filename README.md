# React Hooks Learning App

## Local Dev Setup
```
nvm use
yarn
yarn dev
```
This will start a dev server and provide a url in your terminal.
Copy and paste said url in your browser to see the app, which will update automatically in real-time as you make changes!

## Learning Tasks
```
Step 1: use the useState hook to implement state for this app. Our state will be an array of todos, and should start empty. Delete the temporary todos variable (tempTodos) once this is complete.
Step 2: hook up the todos state to the render
Step 3: update handleCreateNewTodo() so that when a user clicks the create new todo button, a new todo will be added to state
Step 4: update handleTodoDoneClick() function so that the done button deletes a todo when clicked
Step 5: create a useEffect hook to "alert" the user whenever a new todo is created - e.g., window.alert("New Todo created!")
Step 6: create a useEffect hook that will "alert" the user once with a welcome message, when the page loads
```
